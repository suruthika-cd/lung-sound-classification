## Data Description

This project uses lung sound audio recordings to build a deep learning model
for classifying respiratory sounds.

### Type of Data
- Audio recordings of lung sounds
- Used to identify normal and abnormal breathing patterns

### Data Usage
- Audio signals are preprocessed and converted into numerical features
- Extracted features are used to train and evaluate the classification model

### Dataset Availability
- The original dataset is not included in this repository
- Reasons:
  - Medical data privacy and ethical considerations
  - Large dataset size
